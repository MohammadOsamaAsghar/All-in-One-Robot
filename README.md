# All-in-One-Robot
A DIY Robot comprised of two microcontrollers, namely the ESP32 and Arduino Nano; integrated with multiple sensors. An IR Sensor Array [TCRT5000] for Line Following, Ultrasonic Sensor for Obstacle Avoidance, Color Sensor [TCS3200], 0-25V Voltage Sensor Module, and Current Sensor [ACS712]. The data is displayed on an OLED and stored in an SD Card.
